# Furiends User Guide

Furiends is a **desktop app tailored towards animal lovers, specifically individuals who are tasked to feed stray animals.** It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Furiends can help you manage people and animals, as well as allocate people to certain animals for scheduled feeding, faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Furiends application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar furiends.jar` command 
   to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   For more details on the GUI, refer to the [Overview of GUI](#overview-of-gui) section.

5. Type the command in the command box (displaying "Enter command here...") and press Enter to execute it.<br>
   Some simple commands you can try:

   * `help` : Shows the help page with the full list of commands.
   
   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview of GUI
![Ui](images/Ui_explanation.png)

The GUI is made up of the following components:
1. **Options Panel**: Contains menu bars to exit (File > Exit) and open the help panel (Help > Help).
2. **Command Box**: Commands are entered in this text box. Press the Enter key to execute the command.
3. **Feedback Box**: The app displays the result of the executed command in this box.
4. **Person View**: Displays the list of persons stored in the address book.
5. **Animal View**: Displays the list of animals stored in the address book.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add person n/NAME...`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add person n/John Doe...`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME ... [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe ... t/friend` (friend tag added) 
  or as `n/John Doe ... `(no tag provided).

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters 
  (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Furiends will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
